## Project Background

Increasingly, hospitals are being mandated to monitor patient wellbeing post-treatment through Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). These are typically collected using questionnaires designed to receive subjective responses from patients to give a measure of the patient's sense of health and wellbeing. The questionnaires are often distributed in **paper form**, which dramatically increases the time that it takes to collect and analyse (given the questionnaires are mailed to the houses of the patients) and ultimately, the process of collecting and analysing the responses to these questionnaires can take **up to a year** to finalize (Background information about PROMs - NHS Digital, 2021).

This problem doesn't just exist in the clinic - it also exists in the classroom. The principles of PROMs are also directly applicable to teaching, for example: considering topic evaluation worksheets, module evaluation questionnaires and student feedback forms. Responses to these questionnaires can also provide vital feedback to educators in addition to clinicians, and operate on the same general principles. Yet in most classrooms across schools in Wales, these feedback forms are still distributed and collected using pen and paper despite the technology available to perform the same task digitally.

Our client, Dr Joseph Connor (NHS) has taken an active interest in resolving both of the issues defined above.

## Project Goals

<br>

The objectives of this project were to produce a **general** web app capable of gathering PROMs data per individuals, allowing clinicians to understand the factors that help and hinder an individual from adherence to set treatment plans in the clinic and the equivalent data in the classroom. If developed, the solution would significantly speed the time taken to create, collate, distribute and analyse responses to questionnaires in both clinical and classroom settings and prove immensely useful in both contexts.

## Gathering Requirements

<br>


We identified our users by interviewing our client, who referred us to KS2 teachers (who in turn, referred us to KS2 students). Throughout this process, we sought a description of the environment where the problem was occurring using semi-structured interviews (Blandford, 2013) with open-ended questions – allowing us to probe further when needed. Examples of questions included:

<!-- Beginning of Questions to Teachers -->

Questions to teachers (answered by pseudo-users):​

<span style="color:blue">What do you consider the greatest pain point during the process of engaging students in school activities (physical or otherwise)?​</span>

Aside from using pictures or animations and rewards, I don’t know what I could do to make the students engage more with my activities, and I don’t really have any way to know whether my students are reacting positively to the way that I am making changes or not.​

<span style="color:blue">What do you think is the solution to this problem?​​</span>

Some kind of application which allows me to get feedback from my students as to how they’re getting on.​

<span style="color:blue">Who would be the potential users of this solution, other than yourself?​</span>

My students themselves – but they are only in Key Stage 2.​

<span style="color:blue">What format do you think would be most suitable for the final solution (e.g., mobile application, web application, wearable device)?​​</span>

I think a solution on the web would be most suitable, since most students their age don’t own a mobile phone, and we could even allocate some time during their existing IT sessions for them to provide this feedback.​

<span style="color:blue">Where would this solution (mainly) be used?​​</span>

In the classroom, since students will be interacting with the system during lesson time on the computers. Teachers may also want to access the system from home.​

<span style="color:blue">When would this system be used?​​</span>

The system would be used daily by students and probably up to multiple times per day by teachers.
