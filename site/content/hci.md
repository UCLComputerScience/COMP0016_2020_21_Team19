## Sketches

Consulting our personas and scenarios, we identified a series of pages (illustrated below) that our solution would implement. We then generated multiple sketches of each page – each with a different layout or design – which we took to our users to see which of the designs they liked most, and why. 
Users had a clear preference to having a menu bar on the side rather than the top, citing that they thought it would make accessing pages much easier. They also expressed clear preferences to having tasks appear in a simple list form, citing that the other designs were too complicated to manage. The most popular designs for each page according to our users have been highlighted in green.
