In a clinical setting, there exist numerous solutions to the Patient Reported Outcome Measure collection system, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. Click into each of the headings below to learn more about them:

    <div id="flush-collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
     <div class="accordion-body">AssisTek's eDiary is one of the most unique solutions to the problem of collecting and analysing PROMs data. Interestingly, they issue <b>7" tablets</b> pre-loaded with medical content, newsletters and the ability to fill out routine medical questionnaires/provide PROMs data. Among its' many interesting features are: <b>multi-lingual support, email and SMS notifications</b> to the handlers of patients if something appears to be wrong and <b> effectively eliminating the need for data source verification [1].</b>

     <br><br>
     Though creating and distributing a tablet is out of the scope of this project, particularly given that the vast majority of the population is in possession of a device which could be used to provide responses to PROMs, we can draw inspiration from the way that they have essentially designed away the need for source verification with their tablets, given that those without a tablet (who are not supposed to be responding to PROMs) cannot do so.

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingTwo" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">Critical Data Solution's ePRO is available as an app on iOS, Android or as a web application. It sends notifications when there is a new form to be filled out, and allows Surveyors to view the data as it comes in from Respondents. Though the notifications process can be completely automated, it is also possible for Surveyors to send manual notifications to Respondents that they manage should they choose to do so. They also have some inventive response types to questions - allowing patients to colour in certain regions of the body that they feel they are experiencing pain in. Lastly, the app also contains <b>eConsent</b>, allowing patients to sign remotely at the bottom of the form to verify the authenticity of the sender of clinical outcomes [2].

      <br><br>
      There is a lot for us to draw from this application: the use of a <b>web application</b> in particular is a very suitable choice given the problem setting, and the ability to <b>send notifications</b> to Respondents either automatically or manually in itself could later prove very useful as a measure to increase the proportion of Respondents responding to a questionnaire in a timely manner.

    <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingThree" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">SignantHealth's eCOA and ePRO solutions focus on ensuring quality data is returned by users. Their solutions ensure that when responses are submitted that there is no conflicting information within them and that there is never anything missing from the forms that are submitted. They also provide automated notifications to ensure the timely completion of distributed questionnaires [3].
      <br><br>
      There are unique aspects in this project which we can also learn from: the importance of being able to ensure that data is not missing or invalid when submitted in response to a questionnaire is of paramount importance to the analysis of the data to be done by a Surveyor. Being able to validate these forms, and prevent them from being sent off if they are invalid is most certainly something that we will be conducting further research into throughout the duration of this project.

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseFour" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingFour" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">LifeSphere's Clinical eCOA is an enterprise-level solution to managing clinical outcomes covering each layer of the enterprise - from governing individual questionnaires and responses to providing enterprise-level reporting. It is incredibly specialised and feature-rich, containing defining features such as a <b> dashboard </b> and <b> visualisations </b> of the responses that have been obtained to a particular task. It also contains administratively useful features, such as the ability to <b> bulk import and export </b> documents from the platform. In industry, it satisfies the "Bring Your Own Device" principle and is accessible as a <b> web application </b>[4]. 
      <br><br>
      <img src="../images/research/lifesphere_ecoa.png" alt="ePRO" style="max-width: 50%">
      <br><br>
      We belive eCOA and its' features bear the greatest resemblence to the solution which we will likely end up developing: it provides <b> analysis tools </b> for responses to the questionnaires that are submitted through there, and makes the process of visualising and hence understanding the factors that help and hinder an individuals adherence to a treatment plan dramatically simpler and shorter. Though the solution is significantly more specialised than is desired by our requirement of generalisation, ultimately the similarity between the two platforms leads us to believe that this is the solution from which we will draw the most inspiration from.
      <br><br>
      This solution also appears to be a solution favoured in practise by larger organisations too, with notable clients including Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Novartis using it [4].

    </h2>
    <div id="flush-collapseFive" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="flush-headingFive" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">Castor's ePRO solution provides a seemingly lightweight, specialised and feature rich solution for us to emulate during our own generation of a generalised solution. Specifically, features of interest include <b>a multitude of response types to questionnaire questions, including: slider scales, text, comments, checkboxes and drop-downs</b>. They have also added the ability to <b> bulk invite survey participants to the platform </b> and have introduced the concept of <b> progress </b> in responses to questionnaires that have been completed. Once a participant has completed a survey, the survey is also <b> auto-locked </b>, preventing the participant from continually changing their answers and interfering with the analysis process. Like some of the other solutions, it also has introduced email notifications [5]. 
      <br><br>
      <img src="../images/research/castor_epro.png" alt="ePRO" style="max-width: 50%">
      <br><br>
      This source in particular deserves special consideration in our research and review procedure due to its paradigm shift in the understanding of a response, and the information that a response contains. Their inclusion of the concept of <b> progress </b> implies a sentiment associated with the responses to questions on a questionnaire, such as a positive sentiment for questions which imply that a quantitative question with a higher value associated to it means more progress has been made, or that it is an arbitrarily better answer.
      <br><br>
      Given our requirements to produce a generalisable platform with clinical applications, this interpretation of sentiment is likely to be incredibly useful to us in future: for example, when a clinician might want to understand whether a patient's interpretation of their general wellbeing is improving over time or not. Furthermore, the multitude of response types may also be something to draw upon in the construction of a generalised platform and the addition of usability features such as <b> bulk upload </b> of new users would likely be a massive plus for the user experience, and hence something that we will consider.
