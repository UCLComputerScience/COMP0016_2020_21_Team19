    title: The Problem
    subtitle: >-
      NHS clinicians have no reliable, centralised mechanism to gather Patient
      Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) per individual and to understand the
      factors that help and hinder an individual from adherence to set treatment
      plans.
      This problem doesn't just exist in the NHS. Reported outcomes and
      subsequent analysis are a vital feedback mechanism in numerous disciplines,
      from classrooms to hospital wards.

        details: |-
          PROMs are typically collected by mailing paper questionnaires to patients.
          The NHS reports that for a single group of patients, PROMs data can take up to a year to collect.
        highlight: true
      - title:
        price: Difficult to Analyse
        details: |-
          Collecting responses of physical questionnaires means manually updating records - providing no quick and easy visualisations to assist in analysing the response data.
        highlight: true
      - title:
        price: Necessary
        details: |-
          It is becoming increasingly important for doctors to continue monitoring the health of their patients after they've been discharged.
          Many hospitals are now mandated to do so.

    title: Our Solution
    subtitle: >-
      Our solution dramatically reduces the time taken to collect and analyse responses to PROMs and may allow them to uncover health-related issues that would have gone undiscovered if assessed purely on the existing patient consultation framework.
