## Going beyond the requirements

<br>

In addition to the features initially requested by our client, we added some some features which we thought would enchance the user experience. Some of these include:

* **Making the platform invite-only** such that only people who have been granted access by a member of an existing organisation can join the system. This was done in the interest of security and to establish an organisational structure so that multiple institutions can use the system as completely separate entitites on just one deployed instance.

* **Adding the ability for users to upload spreadsheets** containing email addresses which the system then sends invitations to. Since clinics and schools often use spreadsheets to store data, we thought this would be a convenient feature for our users.

* **Custom ranges for visualisations**. We realise that users may want to view graphs for a certain period of time rather than a fixed value which they cannot change. Hence, we added a custom date range selector to each graph.

* **Dark mode**. To improve accessibility and cater for the use of our application at all hours, we added a dark mode toggle.

<br>

## Known bugs

<br>

* Chart.js rendering can occasionally take up a large vertical space (this is likely to be a bug within Chart.js)
* On Internet Explorer, the Activity League logo occasionally does not appear at the top left corner of the page.

<br>

## Critical evaluation

<br>

### User interface

<br>

UI/UX was an important consideration for us throughout the duration of the project, as we realised that it's directly tied to how users would perceive our site. Hence, we paid close attention to our page layouts and tried to adhere to [best practices](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-interface-design.html) as much as possible.

Our client and TA were important sources of feedback which helped us to refine our user interface.

<div id="carouselUI" class="carousel carousel-dark slide mb-3" data-bs-ride="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-indicators" style="bottom:-30px">
    <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselUI" data-bs-slide-to="0" class="active" aria-current="true" aria-label="Slide 1"></button>
    <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselUI" data-bs-slide-to="1" aria-label="Slide 2"></button>
  </div>
  <div class="carousel-inner pb-4">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <img src="../images/evaluation/task_overview_old.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Teacher Dashboard">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block" style="bottom:-50px">
        <h5>Task Overview (Prototype)</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <img src="../images/evaluation/task_overview_new.png" class="d-block w-100" alt="Teacher Task Overview">
      <div class="carousel-caption d-none d-md-block" style="bottom:-50px">
        <h5>Task Overview (Final)</h5>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselUI" data-bs-slide="prev" style="left:-80px">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
  </button>
  <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselUI" data-bs-slide="next" style="right:-80px">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
  </button>
</div>

<img src="../images/evaluation/tooltip.png">

As can be seen from the images above, we iterated on our user interface by conducting major overhauls to adding incremental features such as tooltips. These modification were done in order to ensure users felt informed and in control of the interface at all times, reducing [cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/#:~:text=In%20the%20field%20of%20user,required%20to%20operate%20the%20system.&text=The%20term%20%22cognitive%20load%22%20was,required%20to%20learn%20new%20information.).

We were pleased to hear that our client found our interface simple to use, whilst remaining visually appealing.

Due to the time constraints of the project, we weren't able to implement some small details which would resulted in an even more polished user experience. For example, using [toasts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/toasts/) as responses to user actions instead of the currently implemented [`alert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) dialogs.

<br>

### Functionality

<br>

We are pleased to have implemented 100% of the features our client requested and a few extra ones. Our web app meets the core needs of a clinic/school which wants to collect user-reported outcomes such as the creation of groups, tasks and ability for responses to be collected and analysed. In addition to this, we have added convenience features, such as the upload of spreadsheets to enable easier creation of groups, to enhance the user experience.

All the dependencies of the application are completely open-sourced. We actively sought to use well-reputed third-party packages to handle mission-critical features such as authentication, following the principle of not designing our own security. Not only does this reduce coupling among different components, but also ensures that our authentication system is **resilient to vulnerabilities** as updates to the open source packages trickle down into our app without our direct intervention.

<br>

### Stability

<br>

Our application is stable and there are no major concerns regarding its stability. Our confidence in this claim is grounded by our **thorough approach to testing** individual components, end-to-end user actions, and webpage performance. Furthermore, our automated [Continuous Integration and Deployment](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team19/actions) workflows ensure that our web app retains consistent behaviour.

The main consideration to keep in mind with regards to stability is that our web app is currently deployed on a Linode server with only 1 Core and 1 GB RAM, and therefore has fairly limited capacity in the number of concurrent requests and data it can handle.
However, this should be very easy for future developers to circumvent especially since Linode offers load balancers as a service (LBaaS) – [NodeBalancers](https://www.linode.com/products/nodebalancers/).
<br>

### Efficiency

<br>

From the performance testing we conducted using [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), our website was rated highly for performance. We acheived this by optimising our code in places where we could. This is also in part thanks to Django's ORM and [lazy `QuerysSets`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/#querysets-are-lazy) which ensured that database queries were highly optimised for Disk IO performance which is [often the bottleneck](https://go.forrester.com/blogs/11-02-13-the_nastiest_performance_bottleneck_is_often_the_database/).

Our Linode server also shows that overall, our application is relatively efficient, with peak CPU % usage being below 8%, and peak Disk IO being below 40 blocks/s.

    <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
  </button>
  <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselEfficiency" data-bs-slide="next" style="right:-80px">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
  </button>
</div>

With that being said, we think there are further optimisations that could be made as our focus in this department was somewhat limited due to the time constraints of the project.

<br>

### Compatibility

<br>

The web app has been tested extensively on a variety of browsers and mobile devices. Through [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), our framework of choice for end-to-end integration tests, we were able to automate testing on Chrome and Firefox. This covers a majority of use cases as these among the [most popular desktop browsers in the world](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide).

<div id="desktop-browser-ww-monthly-202002-202102" style="width:100%"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/worldwide">StatCounter Global Stats - Browser Market Share</a></p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.statcounter.com/js/fusioncharts.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://gs.statcounter.com/chart.php?desktop-browser-ww-monthly-202002-202102&chartWidth=600"></script>

Since Cypress [does not support](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Browsers) Internet Explorer (the browser most commonly used in the NHS according to our client) or Safari (the second most popular browser as seen in the chart above), we had to test these manually. While Safari flawlessly allowed for the desired user experience, Internet Explorer posed some challenges due to the fact it [does not support jQuery](https://caniuse.com/?search=jquery) and [support has been discontinued by Microsoft since 12 Dec 2016](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-ie-support), therefore leaving some room for improvement.

Our app is fully responsive and can hence be used on mobile devices without an issue.

<br>

### Maintainability

<br>

Code quality was an important consideration for us throughout the project, as we understood that our work would have little to no value if future developers couldn't easily work on the codebase. To that end, we have spent a lot of time documenting our code and implementing [Django design patterns and best practices](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Django_Design_Patterns_and_Best_Practice/WzW9BwAAQBAJ).

We used [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate [method-by-method documentation](../docs/py-modindex.html) which we hope will clarify in great detail to future developers how different components of our application interoperate.
Our implementation of the MVT design pattern principally decouples different aspects of our codebase making it easy for developers to add functionality very quickly.

We have also created a detailed deployment manual which is available on both the [project README](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team19) and in a [dedication section in the Guide](../guide/deployment_manual/).

<br>

### Project Management

<br>

As a team, we met several times per week to work collaboratively on the code and the vast majority of work was completed using [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share). We found this to be the most productive method for coding as we could combine our ideas and work cohesively, whilst also making less mistakes.

A Trello board was created for communicating important documentation and progress with our client. This was a great way of keeping everything organised and providing a structural roadmap for the development process.
We heavily used [GitHub issues](https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0016_2020_21_Team19/issues) to keep track of potential new features and existing bugs. This greatly improved synchronisation as all team members were equally aware of the different tasks to complete.
These tools enables us to quickly iterate on our design and update our client, establishing a necessary feedback mechanism.

## Future work

<br>

Given more time to work on the project, these are some of the things we would work on which can be picked up by future developers:

* Fixing the [known bugs](#known-bugs).
* Adding an email notification system which notifies Respondents each time they have a new task to complete and Surveyors each time a response is received.
* Adding an additional feature which allows Surveyors to collectively view responses to tasks created using different templates.
