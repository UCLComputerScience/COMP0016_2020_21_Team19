In this tutorial, you're going to: Sign Up and Create an Organisation Create a Group Invite Respondents to your Group Create a Task Accept an invitation and Sign Up as a Respondent Respond to the Task Info This guide is intended as a first use guide to introduce you to the workflows of the two different user types. For more detailed information about the system and its functionality see the User Manual for both the Surveyor and Respondent . Sign Up and Create an Organisation Activity League is an invite-only platform, so to sign up as a Surveyor, you either have to be invited by an existing organisation or create a new one for yourself. We're going create an organisation! Navigate to the Sign In page, click the Create Organisation button at the bottom of the page. You'll be redirected to this page: Enter the name of the organisation that you want to create, followed by your email address, firstname, surname and password.

You will be assigned as the admin user of that organisation and you'll be redirected to your dashboard (which will be empty at the moment). Create a Group To create a group, navigate from your dashboard to the groups page and click on the New Group button. A pop-up like this will appear: Give the group that you want to create a name in the pop-up. When you're done, click the Create Group button on the same pop-up. Once you've done this: congratulations! You've created a new group.! Invite Respondents to your Group To add a Respondent to the new group, click on the Add Participant button. This pop-up will appear: The top of the pop-up of this form allows you to select a respondent you already manage (if you already manage any) from the drop-down menu at the top of the pop-up and select the user you wish to add from there. Since you don't manage any Respondents on the system, we'll need to invite one using their email. Get the email of a partner (or another email account which you can access) and enter it in the provided text field. Press the Send Invite button. The invitation will be sent to the provided email! Info Remember to sign out after sending the invite. Create a Task Navigate back to your dashboard using the sidebar on the left. Once you're there, press on the New Task button.

If the question is complex, or may require reference from the user, you may add a URL for them to refer to if they get stuck. On the right-hand side, you'll see a drop-down box allowing you to select the Response Type of the question you're setting. If the question you're setting is looking for short, textual responses, you can select this from the drop down menu (select Text (Positive) if the answers are looking for positively-associated words, Text (Negative) if the other way around and Text if the responses won't have any particular affiliation). These text responses will later be shown to us as word clouds! Otherwise, select from the quantitative responses in the drop-down box. Feel free to add more questions using the Add More button! Set a task deadline using the picker at the bottom. Once you're done with this, click Submit . Congratulations! You've set your first task.

Dashboard The dashboard shows you all of the tasks that have been assigned to you which you have yet to complete. Clicking on a task will take you that task's feedback form, where you can submit your response. Responding to Tasks There are 4 main types of question which you may be asked to answer. Each question may have an associated link to help you with your answer. Likert Scale Likert scale questions allow radio button responses from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree'. 1-5 Scale Similar to Likert scale questions, a 1-5 scale allows discrete numerical responses ranging from 1 to 5. Traffic Light Traffic light questions show three buttons colored red, yellow and green with sad, neutral and happy faces respectively. Text Text questions simply show a text field in which you can input your response. Leaderboard Clicking on the Leaderboard tab in the sidebar will take you to the page below, where you can view your ranking among all the different groups of which you are a member. By default the Overall button will be selected, which shows your ranking across all groups that you manage. You can click on buttons for individual groups to show the leaderboard for that specific group. Progress The progress page allows you to visualise your progress over time within a group and overall since you joined Activity League. The graph at the top of the progress page is the Overall graph, and contains a summary of your progress across all groups that you are in. Each subsequent graph below this represents your progress in each group that you are present. The scores shown are averages over the responses that you have submitted to the questions in the tasks that you have been set. Activity League is designed to promote higher scores, meaning that the leaderboard assumes that higher scores (meaning that response values are higher) indicate positivity, and lower scores indicate negativity. This does not apply to text-based responses. Scoring Activity League averages the quantitative responses that you enter over different time periods to generate scores for both the leaderboard and progress graphs. Activity league assumes that higher scores indicate positive responses and lower scores indicate negative responses . For example, if you enter a higher-valued response because you find tasks easier than before, the average score will increase over time and Activity League will assume that this is positive and desirable.","title":"Respondent"},{"location":"respondent/#respondent","text":"","title":"Respondent"},{"location":"respondent/#launch-the-application","text":"To open the application, navigate to 178.79.143.29:8000 in your browser.","title":"Launch the Application"},{"location":"respondent/#signing-up","text":"If you are invited to join an organisation, clicking the invite link will redirect you to the sign up page.
