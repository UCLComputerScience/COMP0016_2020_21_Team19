## Sketching
After creating our personas and scenarios, we began to create sketches for the main pages of our web application.

We started by creating several sets of sketches for each page of the website, which would act as initial designs for
possible page layouts. We then took these initial sketches to our users, and asked to them choose which of the designs
they preferred. Then for each of the pages, we developed a further set of improved sketched based on the intial sketch
which appealed most to our users.

The images below show inital sketches for the teacher's dashboard, student's dashboard, and student
feedback form.

From these intial designs for the teacher dashboard, the users preferred the design in the top-right, stating that
it was the most visually appealing layout. Therefore we produced the following improved sketches to develop on this
initial design.

### Student Dashboard

After consulting our users, there was a clear preference for the bottom-right design. One of the reasons given was
that the simple list format for tasks was considered much more intuitive than the alternative designs. Another reason
was the sidebard was the preferred option for navigation between pages.

From the initial feedback form designs, the preferred layout was the design given in the top-right sketch. The users
believed this design to have the best balance between simplicity and granularity of feedback.
