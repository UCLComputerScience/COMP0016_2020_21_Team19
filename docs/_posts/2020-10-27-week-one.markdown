# Gathering Requirements

After meeting with our client, we have established the following ideas/problems:

- We are building a web app for teachers to be able to track student progress.

- The web app is mainly for tracking their physical activity but should be usable for other purposes.

- Teachers are able to specify a set of objectives for students to achieve.

- The web app allows students to give feedback thorugh a Likert Scale and also describing, in 5 words, what they found held them back and what helped them to achieve the objective.

- The feedback needs to be viewable in a graphic format, and the feedback needs to be transformed into a word cloud specific to each student and school.

- We could implement a league table for students, in order to motivate them towards achieving the objective

- There needs to be a focus on code-readability

# Tech Stack

- Django (for the web framework)

- SQL database

- Linode (web server)
