# Representing Users

This week, the three of us decided to create personas and scenarios to use as a frame of reference for our later designs. To do this, we had a semi-structured interview with our client in which we asked our client who our users should be. Here, we were told that we would have two principle users of the solution - KS2 teachers and their corresponding students.

Given our module constraints (not being able to engage with KS2 users), we had our friends, coursemates and relatives simulate KS2 students in another semi-structured interview that we had designed.
