Continuing on from last week, this week we worked on developing the frontend for the Interviewer. As with the Interviewee frontend which we
developed last week, all of the pages were hardcoded without integration with the backend. This has allowed us to focus primarily on creating
an accurate frontend to match our Figma prototypes without having to ensure that the backend is properly integrated at the same time.

## Next Steps

Next week we plan to complete our work on the frontend. As we move forward, we also plan to start integrating our frontend with the Django
backend. This will involve designing a database schema, and using this to create a MySQL database to store the data associated with our
application.
